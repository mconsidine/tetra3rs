        Companion to ``test_tiered_calibration`` (SIP polynomial). The
        ``"radial"`` model fits the full Brown-Conrady form
        ``(cx, cy, k1, k2, k3, p1, p2)`` jointly via Levenberg-Marquardt:
        radial coefficients capture the symmetric component, tangential
        coefficients (p1, p2) capture decentering. The test verifies that:

          1. ``calibrate_camera(model="radial", ...)`` runs end-to-end
             through the alternating-refinement multi-image path.
          2. The fitted CameraModel carries a RadialDistortion (not None,
             not PolynomialDistortion).
          3. Calibration meaningfully reduces residuals vs. the
             un-calibrated solve.
          4. All sectors re-solve with attitude agreeing with the FITS WCS
             to within ~2 arcminutes per image.

        Bounds are looser than the polynomial test because the 7-parameter
        Brown-Conrady model captures less distortion than a 4th-order SIP
        polynomial — but tight enough to reliably distinguish a working fit
        from a regression.
