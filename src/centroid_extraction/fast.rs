/// An alternative to [`extract_centroids_from_raw`] that reads each pixel
/// **once**: a cheap subsampled pre-pass builds a coarse background grid, then
/// a single raster sweep thresholds against the bilinearly-interpolated
/// background, groups lit pixels into connected regions via run-length +
/// union-find (accumulating intensity-weighted moments inline), and emits a
/// center-of-mass per region. No convolution, no full-image background buffer,
/// no second pass — so it is memory-bandwidth-bound rather than compute-bound,
/// and markedly faster than the connected-component path (which stays the
/// default and the right choice for calibration / faint-star work).
///
/// # Trade-offs
///
/// - No matched filter, so faint-star sensitivity is lower — sized for the
///   brightest stars a tracker locks onto, not deep detection.
/// - Center-of-mass is threshold-clipped: sub-pixel accuracy is ~0.1 px for
///   bright stars, degrading for faint ones. A 3×3 parabola refine on the peak
///   ([`quadratic_peak_offset`]) sharpens it when the region is large enough
///   and the fit agrees with the CoM, matching the CCL path's gate.
/// - A global noise σ is used (adequate when read/shot noise is roughly
///   uniform even where the background level is not).
///
/// Returns the same [`CentroidExtractionResult`] as the CCL path (centroids in
/// image-center-origin coordinates, brightest first), so it is a drop-in for
/// [`SolverDatabase::solve_from_centroids`](crate::SolverDatabase::solve_from_centroids).
/// `background_mean` is the median of the coarse grid, `background_sigma` the
/// global noise σ, `threshold` a representative `bg_mean + k·σ`, and
/// `num_blobs_raw` the region count before the `min_pixels` filter.
